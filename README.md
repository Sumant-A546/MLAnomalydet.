# MLAnomalydet.

This project aims to detect anomalies in a given dataset using machine learning techniques, particularly clustering and visualization. In this README, you'll find an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the environment, and details on how to use the provided code.

## Overview

Anomaly detection is a critical task in various domains, such as fraud detection, network security, and quality control. This project leverages clustering and visualization to identify anomalies in a dataset. We use the K-means clustering algorithm and visualize the anomalies to gain insights into their patterns.

## Dataset

We use the following dataset for anomaly detection:

Code Explanation
The code provided in this repository includes several functions and visualization techniques for anomaly detection. Here's a brief explanation of each section:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is preprocessed, including feature scaling and dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Clustering: The K-means clustering algorithm is applied to the preprocessed data to group similar data points.

Anomaly Detection: Anomalies are detected based on the distance of each data point to its nearest cluster centroid. The code includes a function for calculating these distances.

Visualization: Anomalies are visualized using scatter plots and histograms. Anomalies are typically marked in a different color for easy identification.
